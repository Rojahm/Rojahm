 👋 Hi, I’m @Rojahm
 <hr />
 👩‍💻 I work as I.T. admin in a small institute. Microsoft MCITP Style! I enjoy working but there is not much for me to learn here, so I'm trying to change.
 <br />
 done with studying nodejs and working with expressjs, nextjs and redux projects
 <br />
 👀 I’m interested in a great remote job, to spend more time with my cats and less time commuting! 
 <br />
 💻 Interesed in linux and working to get my LPIC-1
 <br />
 🌱 Finished learning practical coding(JS) at SheCodes Workshops, Thanks to SheCodes Foundation
 <br />
 👊 Love the front-end and exploring react everyday. Since i have to really undrestand how things completely work I'm learning my way through Redux, Database structures, Nodejs and cloud microservices. I don't aim to do everything at once myself because that's what you do when you know how vastly detailed with tricks and practices every framework is. And i love to master the fabulous tricks of frameworks i work with after i'm sure i know how everything works in the whole development and production process.
